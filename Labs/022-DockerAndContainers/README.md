# Lab 022 - Docker and Containers with Copilot

!!! hint "Overview"

    - In this lab, you will use GitHub Copilot to write Dockerfiles, Docker Compose configurations, and multi-stage builds.
    - Copilot has deep knowledge of containerization best practices including image layering, caching, and security hardening.
    - You will also use Copilot to debug container runtime errors, interpret logs, and fix networking and volume issues.
    - By the end of this lab, you will be able to rely on Copilot as a knowledgeable container engineering assistant.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Lab 021 - API Design](../021-APIDesign/README.md)
- Docker installed locally

## What You Will Learn

- How to generate optimized Dockerfiles for different runtimes
- How to create multi-stage builds for minimal image sizes
- How to write Docker Compose configurations
- How to debug container networking and volume issues
- How to generate Kubernetes manifests from Compose files

---

## Lab Steps

### Step 1 - Generate an Optimized Dockerfile

```
Create a production-optimized Dockerfile for a Node.js 20 Express API with:
- Multi-stage build (builder + production stage)
- Non-root user for security
- Layer caching optimized (dependencies before source code)
- Health check endpoint
- Environment variable for PORT (default 3000)
- Final image based on node:20-alpine
```

Expected output structure:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:20-alpine AS production
...
```

### Step 2 - Optimize an Existing Dockerfile

Paste this bloated Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs npm
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD node server.js
```

Ask:

```
This Dockerfile has several problems: large image size, security issues,
and poor layer caching. Rewrite it following best practices:
- Use a minimal base image
- Pin versions
- Run as non-root
- Optimize layer caching
- Use .dockerignore
```

### Step 3 - Create a Docker Compose Stack

```
Write a Docker Compose file for a full-stack application with:
- Next.js frontend (port 3000)
- Node.js Express API (port 4000)
- PostgreSQL 16 database (with persistent volume)
- Redis for session storage (port 6379)
- Nginx reverse proxy (ports 80, 443)

Include:
- Health checks for all services
- Depends-on with service_healthy conditions
- Environment variables via .env file
- Named volumes for persistence
- A separate `docker-compose.dev.yml` override for development
```

### Step 4 - Debug Container Issues

```
My Docker container keeps restarting. Here's the output of `docker logs myapp`:

[paste log output]

What's causing the restart loop and how do I fix it?
```

Or:

```
Two containers (api and db) can't communicate.
Here's my docker-compose.yml:

[paste compose file]

What's wrong with the networking configuration?
```

### Step 5 - Write a .dockerignore File

```
#file:package.json
#file:.gitignore

Generate a .dockerignore file for this Node.js project.
Exclude everything that shouldn't be in the build context:
dev dependencies, test files, documentation, local configs, etc.
```

### Step 6 - Convert Compose to Kubernetes

```
#file:docker-compose.yml

Convert this Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests:
- Deployment for each service
- Service objects (ClusterIP for internal, LoadBalancer for public)
- ConfigMap for environment variables
- Secret for sensitive values
- PersistentVolumeClaim for the database

Generate separate YAML files per resource.
```

### Step 7 - Scan for Container Security Issues

```
#file:Dockerfile

Review this Dockerfile for security vulnerabilities:
- Running as root
- Exposed secrets in ENV layers
- Use of latest tags
- Unnecessary packages installed
- Missing HEALTHCHECK
- Sensitive files copied into image
```

## Docker Best Practices Quick Reference

| Practice                   | Why                                                      |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use Alpine/distroless base | Smaller attack surface and image size                    |
| Multi-stage builds         | Keep build tools out of production image                 |
| Non-root USER              | Reduce privilege escalation risk                         |
| Pin image versions         | Reproducible builds                                      |
| COPY package.json first    | Better layer caching                                     |
| Use .dockerignore          | Faster builds, no secrets in context                     |
| Add HEALTHCHECK            | Container orchestration can restart unhealthy containers |
